        <div class=" description active">
            <p>The Basílica de la Sagrada Família was the inspiration of a bookseller, Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of
                Asociación Espiritual de Devotos de San José (Spiritual Association of Devotees of St. Joseph).
                After a visit to the Vatican in 1872, Bocabella returned from Italy with the intention of building a
                church inspired by the basilica at Loreto.The apse crypt of the church, funded by donations, was begun
                19 March 1882, on the festival of St. Joseph, to the design of the architect Francisco de Paula del
                Villar, whose plan was for a Gothic revival church of a standard form.The apse crypt was completed
                before Villar's resignation on 18 March 1883, when Antoni Gaudí assumed responsibility for its design,
                which he changed radically.Gaudi began work on the church in 1883 but was not appointed Architect
                Director until 1884.</p>

        <div class="description ">
            <p>Parc Güell (Catalan: Parc Güell ; Spanish: Parque Güell) is a public park system composed of gardens and
                architectural elements located on Carmel Hill, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Carmel Hill belongs to
                the mountain range of Collserola – the Parc del Carmel is located on the northern face. Park Güell is
                located in La Salut, a neighborhood in the Gràcia district of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind,
                Eusebi Güell assigned the design of the park to Antoni Gaudí, a renowned architect and the face of
                Catalan modernism.<br>
                The park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In
                1984,UNESCOdeclared the park a World Heritage Site under "Works of Antoni Gaudí".</p>
